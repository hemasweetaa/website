           <h3 style="color:aquamarine;"><p style="font-family:Lucida Sans;"> Dance studios may enter their students into the competition in their stead, provided that they have permission to do so by a parent or legal guardian of each student, or from the dancers themselves if they are 18 years of age or older.
            
            
            
            Studio logos are allowed in dancers’ videos, as long as they appear in one of the upper corners of the videos.  Any student who becomes a First Round Finalist will have their video posted on the Finalist Gallery of the website, along with the studio’s name and website (provided the studio name and website were included when filling out the competition entry form).
